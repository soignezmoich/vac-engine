Simulation is used to assess whether a ruleset meets business requirements. A blueprint simulation is a collection of input/output definitions. The output corresponds to the expected outcome of the blueprint for the given input. Simulation runner The input descriptions are processed a case runner (similar to the main processor) in order to determine if the corresponding output expectations are met. Stacks, layers, cases The description passed to the runner is actually a &quot;stack&quot; of simple descriptions called &quot;cases&quot; where the higher case's values overwrite the lower case's ones. Cases are refenced as &quot;layer&quot; in the &quot;stack&quot; and may be referenced in several stacks. Only input is composed this way. Lower cases are not intended to describe output. Two-layers &quot;Basic stacks&quot; and &quot;Templates&quot; In the current implementation of the simulation. Stacks are limited to two level. The bottom layer is called a &quot;Template&quot; where the top one is called a &quot;Runnable case&quot;. Blueprint templates and basic stacks Each blueprint simulation has a collection of templates (a many to many relation between cases and blueprints) that can be used as bottom layer cases. Each simulation also has a collection fo &quot;Basic stacks&quot;, each containing a runnable case and optionally a template. The editor allows to pick the template of the basic cases among the simulation's templates, but technically, a template can be any case of the workspace. Case sharing Blueprints can share cases. This automatically occurs when a blueprint is duplicated, but not when a blueprint is exported and reimported where each case is duplicated. When cases are shared, they can be modified at one for every blueprint. This is useful when you want to fix an error. Workspace cases collections Cases Cases are grouped in a multi-layer stack. Each layer is a single case. The content of a case can be used as a base for another case, forming a stack (technically, even a single case is part of a stack). The basic stack is a two-layered stack (used as the only existing stack structure) Cases are created workspace-wide whereas case stacks are limited to the blueprint scope. This structure allows to share cases among several blueprints.","ref":"VacEngine.Simulation.html","title":"VacEngine.Simulation","type":"module"},{"doc":"Creates a new stack with an empty runnable case and no template case.","ref":"VacEngine.Simulation.html#create_blank_stack/2","title":"VacEngine.Simulation.create_blank_stack/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Create a new blank template for the given blueprint with the given name.","ref":"VacEngine.Simulation.html#create_blank_template/2","title":"VacEngine.Simulation.create_blank_template/2","type":"function"},{"doc":"Create a new input entry for the given case, key with the given value.","ref":"VacEngine.Simulation.html#create_input_entry/3","title":"VacEngine.Simulation.create_input_entry/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"Create a new output entry for the given case, key and variable.","ref":"VacEngine.Simulation.html#create_output_entry/3","title":"VacEngine.Simulation.create_output_entry/3","type":"function"},{"doc":"Create a new simulation setting for the given blueprint.

Roles Primary entities to which permissions can be attached. Identification to a specific role can be done by using either a full authentication or through a token passed with the request. Roles can be acquired by two access types: users and api-keys . Users User access allow people to access the web interface of the application. A user can access the application by using a multi-factor authentication with: an email login a password a one-time password provided by an authenticator User is attached to a single role, to which a set of permissions is granted. Api-keys Api-keys accesses are used by api consumers to call the application api. A api-key can access the application by using a token that contain a password and a reference to the role. If an existing token is provided with an api request in the authentication header, the request is automatically associated with the related role and permissions are granted accordingly. Curl example of api call with key: curl https :// example . com / api / p / 8 / run - X POST - H &quot;Authorization: Bearer api_1234567_123456789012345678901234567890&quot; Permissions Granting permission Permissions are rights to do certain actions in the system. A permission is granted to a role to perform a given in a given scope, by using the grant_permission/3 (or toggle_permission/3 ) function: VacEngine.Account . grant_permission ( target_role , :list_blueprints_action , :global ) Checking permission When a piece of code should only be accessed by roles with defined permission, an conditional block containing the can?/3 function should be added. if can? ( role , :access , :editor ) do ... end The function will return true if and only if the current role has the corresponding permission therefore granting access or not to the included code. Actions Actions are atoms describing a specific action. The exact content of the action is defined by the places where can?/3 functions use it as an argument. Scopes A scope determines a context in which a permission is granted. There is three types of scope in the application, the global scope, the worspace scopes and the custom . Global scope The global scope correspond to the whole application. Therefore permissions granted in the global scope are technically &quot;unscoped&quot;. Global scope is designated by the :global atom. Workspace scope A workspace scope is determined by the id of a workspace and grants the rights in the context of this workspace. For example, an :access action permission in the workspace with :id = 1 will grant access only to this workspace. Workspace scopes are designated a tuple containing the :workspace atom and the id of the workspace, e.g.: { :workspace , 2 } Custom scope Other scopes can be created using a custom atom. Schemas Below, the list of the schemas described in the Account module. AccessToken Access tokens can be: API key link token (not implemented yet) oauth refresh token (not implemented yet) oauth access token (not implemented yet) Secret format vary depending of the type BlueprintPermission A blueprint permission gives a permission on a blueprint to a role. GlobalPermission A global permission gives a site wide permission to a role. WorkspacePermission A workspace permissions give a workspace wide permission to a role. Role A role is the representation of an actor (user, api request...) to which permissions can be attached. Session A session is created every time a user log in and bears the user's permissions. If the permissions change, the session must be recreated for the change to take effect. User A user is a login method for a role of type &quot;user&quot;. Workspace The general container for blueprints and portals. Security design The Account module implements the following principe in order to ensure security of the system: Users are authenticated using MFA (login/password + authentication). Treatment of wrong login/password pairs are treated in constant time. Sessions linked to role of all types (api-keys, users, tokens) can be revocated by admin at any time.

It has the following composition: _ Blueprint _ | | 0 .. n 0 .. n | | Variables Deductions ( input , output | intermediate ) 0 .. n | _ Branches _ | | 0 .. n 1 .. n | | Condition Assignment | | 1 1 | | Expession Expression variables Variables describe the values the processor can receive (input), return (output) or compute as intermediary values. They are attached to a type, a position in the input or output and some other properties like optional/required. deductions Deductions are descriptions of how intermediary and output variables should be computed. They are built as tables whose columns correspond to the involved variables (assigned one or ones playing role in conditions) and the rows to subsidiary conditions/assignement branches (if the conditions of the first branch are not met, the second branch is tested, and so on). branches A (possibly empty) set of conditions on certain variables linked with an assignation to other (or same) variables. condition An expression describing when the condition is met based on it's column's variable. assignment An expression describing the value the column's variable should take in case the branch conditions are met. expression Either a constant, a variable or a function involving other expressions that can be computed based on the current variables state. Condition expressions return nullable booleans, assignment expression return a nullable value of the type of the column's variable. Blueprint manipulation Creation and import Blueprints can be created using the create_blueprint/2 function. This function requires you to provide attributes for the blueprint. Update to the blueprint such as modifying name or description can be made using the update_blueprint/2 function. Populating a whole blueprint can done by importing a blueprint from a .json file definition. This is done using the update_blueprint_from_file/2 function. Manipulation A set of functions allow you to directly load and update variables and deductions. Schemas Below, the ecto schemas available in the Processor module. Assignment A variable assignment in the branch of a bluprint deduction. AstType Ecto type for AST serialization to the database. Allows to store tuples as JSON. BindingElement An expression binding element. Binding An expression binding. Blueprint A blueprint describing a full processor. Branch A deduction branch. Column A deduction column (a structuration feature that has no effect when the processor runs on an input.) Condition A condition in a branch. Deduction A blueprint deduction. Expression Expressions can be found in conditions, assignments or variable default values. ListType Ecto type to allow storing a list in a json field.

Portals Portals are the access points of the application. Each portal is responsible to give access to a single processor through the API. Therefore, a protal has a reference exactly one blueprint in the api. The reference is called a &quot;publication&quot;. Interface to consume a portal is made of a pair of calls: the run_cached/1 function and the info_cached/1 function Run function Runs the linked processor on the given input, using the provided api_key to authenticate: { :ok , %{ input : input , output : output } } = Pub . run_cached ( %{ api_key : api_key , portal_id : portal_id , input : input } ) Note that the in-memory compiled processor is used as indicated by the cached suffix. Info function Gets the description of the processor linked to the portal { :ok , %{ input : input_schema , output : output_schema , logic : logic } } = Pub . info_cached ( %{ api_key : api_key , portal_id : portal_id } ) Again, the in-memory compiled processor is used. Note: The decription of the corresponding API endpoints is available in the swagger documentation at /priv/static/docs/api.html . Publications A publication links a processor to a portal. The same processor can be published several times, but a portal can have only one active publication at a time. Create a publication Since a portal must give access to exactly processor, publication is always made with a blueprint as parameter in the publish_blueprint/2 function. This function returns the corresponding publication: { :ok , publication } = Pub . publish_blueprint ( ) Publication deactivation Publication can be deactivated using the deactivate_publication/1 . This is necessary if you want to publish a new form to a given portal. Cache management As stated above, blueprints are stored in cache. API keys are also stored in cache. It is the responsibility of the consumer to refresh the cache when corresponding data should be updated (e.g. when new blueprint is associated to the portal, when the linked blueprint is modified or when the API keys are modified).

The expected input, the structure of the output along with the rules to compute it can be fully customized to answer the different needs of the different regions in switzerland. The system allowing to provide such evaluation is called a processor and its description is called a blueprint . API The application can serve several different processors, each on it's own portal . A portal provides a pair of endpoint: The info endpoint returns the description of the input to provide to and the output to expect from the processor. The run portal that accepts the anonymised profile as input and returns the vaccination opportunities. Web application The user interface of the web application allows to manage the processor descriptions along with the associated portals. Portals and processors are grouped in workspaces that allow to manage several users or groups of users independently, each having access to his/her workspace portals and processors.","ref":"readme.html#vacengine-functionalities","title":"README - VacEngine functionalities","type":"extras"},{"doc":"VacEngine is an api-based deduction system initially developed to determine vaccination opportunities based on a person's anonymised information.

There is two types of environment variables: compile time environment variables run time environment variables Compile time environment variables Must be available on the machine that compiles the application. SESSION_SIGNING_SALT SESSION_ENCRYPTION_SALT SESSION_KEY LIVE_VIEW_SALT FORCE_SSL REMOTE_IP_HEADER All the environment variables above are mandatory. They must be available on the system both: when compiling (i.e. when executing &quot;make release&quot;) or when starting the dev server (i.e. when executing &quot;make server&quot;) Run time environment variables Must be available on the machine that runs the application. The variables are partly different for production and development. Production DATABASE_URL DB_SSL_ENABLED HOST PORT SECRET_KEY_BASE POOL_SIZE ¹ ADDRESS ² SSL_KEY_PATH ³ SSL_CERT_PATH ³ FORCE_SSL ⁴ REMOTE_IP_HEADER ⁴ Optional, defaults to 10. Optional, defaults to ::0 (all IPv6 and IPv4 interfaces). Optional, only necessary if the application is supposed to terminate SSL connections. Optional. Development DATABASE_URL DB_SSL_ENABLED DATABASE_TEST_URL ¹ NO_DEBUG_LOG ² Only necessary to run tests. Optional, prevents debug log output. SESSION_SIGNING_SALT This is the session signing salt. This is a salt and not a secret. Must be a random string between 8 and 32 characters long. This is a compile time variable. SESSION_ENCRYPTION_SALT This is the session encryption salt. This is a salt and not a secret. Must be a random string between 8 and 32 characters long. This is a compile time variable. SESSION_KEY This is the name of the cookie used to store the session. Must be a string between 4 and 16 characters long. This is a compile time variable. LIVE_VIEW_SALT This is the live view salt signing salt. This is a salt and not a secret. Must be a random string between 8 and 32 characters long. This is a compile time variable. FORCE_SSL If set to FORWARDED force SSL is enabled and the X-Forwarded-Proto header is required. If set to FORCE SSL is forced (non HTTP are redirected to HTTPS). REMOTE_IP_HEADER If the app is behind a proxy, set this header to either X-Forwarded-For , X-Real-Ip , or X-Client-Ip . This will tell the App to read the client ip from this header. Do not set if not behind a proxy. DATABASE_URL The database URL to use. Example: postgresql :// user :password@127 . 0.0 . 1 : 5432 / dbname Format When using make to run test, the Makefile will override DATABASE_URL with DATABASE_TEST_URL . DATABASE_TEST_URL Same as DATABASE_URL but used when running tests. HOST The public host of the server. This is used to generate redirect URLs. For example, if set to myapp.example.com then all full URLs would be https://myapp.example.com/path . This is only a hostname, protocol will be forced to https and no path can be added. PORT The HTTP port on which Erlang will listen (can be proxied, but not necessary). POOL_SIZE The postgresql pool size. This is the number of database connection to open. Default to 10. ADDRESS The IP address to bind the HTTP listener to. By default it will use ::0 which will bind to all ipv6 and ipv4 addresses. You can set it to either an ipv6 or ipv4 address. Set it to 127.0.0.1 for ipv4 only localhost listening. SECRET_KEY_BASE This is the secret used to derive all the keys used in the application. Must be a random string between 64 and 120 characters long. This is a secret and must be protected. Modifying this key will invalidate all cookies, sessions, activation tokens. SSL_KEY_PATH Path to a .pem file containing the private key. If both SSL_KEY_PATH and SSL_CERT_PATH are set, the application will terminate SSL itself, and PORT should be set to 443 . SSL_CERT_PATH Path to a .pem file containing the FULL CHAIN certificate. If both SSL_KEY_PATH and SSL_CERT_PATH are set, the application will terminate SSL itself, and PORT should be set to 443 .

FORCE_SSL can be FORWARDED or FORCED Reverse proxy If you use a reverse proxy, you must pass the following headers: X-Real-IP or X-Forwarded-For or X-Client-Ip and set REMOTE_IP_HEADER to the name of the used header (compile time) X-Forwarded-Proto and set FORCE_SSL to FORWARDED Example Nginx configuration: server { listen 443 ssl http2 ; listen [ :: ] : 443 ssl http2 ; include ssl . conf ; include errors . conf ; server_name vac - engine . goyman . com ; location / { proxy_set_header Host $ host ; proxy_set_header X - Real - IP $ remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - For $ proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X - Forwarded - Proto $ scheme ; proxy_http_version 1.1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $ http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection $ http_connection ; proxy_read_timeout 86400 ; proxy_pass http :// 127.0 . 0.1 : 3003 ; } }","ref":"deployment.html#ssl","title":"Deployment - SSL","type":"extras"},{"doc":"To install the development server, please refer to the INSTALLATION.md file.","ref":"development.html","title":"Development","type":"extras"},{"doc":"Start server To start the server, just run the following command: make server Connect to web application You can now connect to the web application on http://localhost:4000 and log in with the credentials make db printed.
